# Reflect before acting

Before implementing any solution:

1. Identify what's missing, incomplete, or incorrect based on the original request
2. Theorize 2-3 possible root causes or approaches
3. Distill to the 1-2 most probable. Only proceed after clear understanding.

If anything is unclear: ask first. Never assume.

Code confidence: don't write code until 98%+ confident in what needs to be done.

Change scope: only update files directly necessary for the request. Do not change UI, layout, or design unless instructed. Never remove features unless directly requested.

UI alerts: always use the site's existing design system for modals, alerts, and confirmations. Never use browser defaults.
